    <!-- Reporting FAQ-->
    <string name="reporting_faq1_header">What is the difference between a Restricted Report and a Standard Report?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq1">
        Both types of reports are confidential in nature. Until you provide Peace Corps with your preference, staff will treat your
        information as if you filed a Restricted Report.\n\n

        A Restricted Report limits your information to only those individuals who have a specific need-to-know that information in order
        to provide you with basic services (medical, mental health, or safety).\n\n

        A Standard Report allows you to access all of the same services offered through Restricted Reporting in addition to other support
        services such as filing a police report, switching host families, and changing to a new site. Because additional services
        may be requested, a Standard Report increases the number of people with a need-to-know.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq2_header">Should I choose Standard or Restricted?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq2">
        The choice between filing a Standard or Restricted Report is an individual one. Some services, however, can only be
        offered under standard reporting. Peace Corps believes it can best support you through standard reporting as it allows
        the agency to leverage additional resources and offer additional services such as conducting an in-depth risk assessment.
        The agency recognizes however that for some Volunteers the most important thing is strict confidentiality and a need for
        as few people to know as possible.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq3_header">What does “need-to-know” mean?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq3">
        A need-to-know means that someone has a specific role that requires basic knowledge about the assault. Only service
        providers typically have a need-to-know and therefore have access to information about the assault as reported by you.
        Only medical staff have information about any medical treatment you receive.\n\n

        A role may be mandated by Peace Corps policies and procedures, US law, or local laws. For example, a Country Director has
        a responsibility to know where each Volunteer is located and new site development requires time and resources managed by
        the Country Director. As such, a Country Director has a need-to-know when a Volunteer requests a site change.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq4_header">What if I change my mind later?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq4">
        All reports start as a Restricted Report. A Volunteer can change from Restricted to Standard at any time. Once a report
        becomes Standard, the report cannot be converted back to Restricted because staff that might help provide additional standard
        report services will have been provided with basic information.\n\n
        Volunteers can request additional services at any time, and Volunteers can discontinue/cancel a request for services at any
        time.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq5_header">Will I get the services/type of reporting I want?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq5">
        Volunteer preferences are very important to Peace Corps. We strive to ensure that Volunteer choices are respected. In
        most cases Volunteers receive all the services they desire. Where something is not possible, Peace Corps staff have a
        responsibility to explain why a service is not possible.\n\n

        Because Peace Corps staff members have a responsibility to protect not only you, but other Volunteers, there may be limited
        situations that require the agency to either disclose your name or convert your report from Restricted to Standard.  This is
        most likely in situations where staff believe there is a serious or imminent threat to your health or safety that Peace Corps
        cannot mitigate without additional support or resources. Conversion of a report without a Volunteer’s consent are very rare.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq6_header">What is a SARL?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq6">
        A SARL is a Sexual Assault Response Liaison. SARLs are typically Peace Corps staff that have had training in how to support
        people that have experienced a sexual assault. SARLs help Volunteers with issues not handled by the PCMO or SSM. For example,
        a SARL might accompany a Volunteer when traveling to an appointment with a local lawyer.

    <string name="radar_step1">
        &lt;b>Recognize the danger&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Be aware of what is going on around you – be on the lookout for suspicious people and for situations that could pose a danger.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Be aware of how others perceive you – are your actions or dress inadvertently attracting unwanted attention?  Are you wearing jewelry, using a camera, working on a laptop, or flashing money that might grab the attention of a criminal?&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Being able to recognize dangers lets us begin to figure out ways to reduce the risks. This is where it’s important to trust your instincts. If you have a bad feeling about something it’s a warning sign. Don’t dismiss it – listen to what that voice in the back of your head is saying or that uneasy feeling in your stomach is telling you.
        For example, when you walk in to a crowded bus terminal, you recognize that there is a risk of being pickpocketed.
    </string>
    <string name="radar_step2">
        &lt;b>Assess your options&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Now that you have recognized a potentially dangerous situation, what can you do in order to reduce the risk you face? In most situations, you will have choices to make. Identify as many options as you can.  For example, you can mitigate the risk
        of going out at night by traveling in a group, by using a trusted taxi or even by choosing to return home at an earlier hour.
    </string>
    <string name="radar_step3">
        &lt;b>Decide what’s best for you&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        After figuring out what options you have, run the different scenarios in your head – say ‘What if’ – and decide which option is the best. You could try to defuse the situation by remaining calm and use good communication skills to keep the situation from escalating.  Maybe try an escape option
        where you run towards safety, not just away from danger.  As a last resort, try a verbal, psychological, or physical defense tactic.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Sometimes your best option might be a bit unconventional. If it’s the best option to keep you safe, then it’s a good option.
    </string>
    <string name="radar_step4">
        &lt;b>Act when the time is right&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        After you decide on your best course of action, decide when to act. Sometimes you’ll need to act right away. Other times you can wait until the danger gets closer – but don’t wait until it gets too close! &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Draw your own imaginary line – set your own personal tripwire. Once the danger crosses that line – whatever you decided for yourself – that’s when you act.
    </string>
    <string name="radar_step5">
        &lt;b>Reassess as the situation changes&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        And because no situation is static, you must constantly reassess your options as the conditions and circumstances change. If you encounter new risks or if you run out of options, start the cycle again.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>

        &lt;b>Characteristics of Sexual Assault&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>\t\t\t&lt;b>Sexual predators often plan sexual assaults&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tSexual assault is not an accident.  Sexual predators know what they want to do, even if they have not already identified a specific target.  Most of them have a plan in mind for how they will select and control someone, or they will seek out an area where a potential victim might be isolated and unable to get help. When we say planned to some extent it may not mean days or weeks in advance but also planned in the particular moment.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>\t\t\t&lt;b>Sexual predators often watch for vulnerabilities and opportunities&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tSexual predators look for cues to indicate they can dominate and control a potential victim. They look for signs indicating that someone would be unlikely or unable to resist.  For instance, people who are unaware of their surroundings, alone or lost; someone who is intoxicated or in some way incapacitated.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>\t\t\t&lt;b>Sexual predators often test the boundaries of potential victims&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tTesting boundaries may involve inappropriate comments, unwanted touching or invading personal space. It is a way of measuring the amount of resistance a potential victim might offer. A person who offers little or no resistance to these advances might be seen as a suitable target.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
    </string>

    <string name="tactics_2">
        &lt;b>Tactics of Sexual Assault&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tAttempt to isolate their potential victim&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\t They may target someone who is already alone. For example, walking alone, or they may try to get their target alone by offering a ride in their car.&lt;br/> &lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tPersuasion and confidence&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tThis is the “Smooth Talker” who puts you at ease.  They make you feel comfortable and relaxed so you are not aware of their true intent.  They may try to persuade you to do something you feel uncomfortable about.  They might promise that they won’t try anything with you or reassure you by saying “You can trust me.”&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tPressure and guilt&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tSexual predators may try to coerce you by pressuring you to go farther in a relationship than you are ready or willing to go.  They may try to make you feel guilty if you do not give in to their advances. They might say “You are offending me culturally” or something similar to make Volunteers feel guilty.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tThreats and intimidation&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tSometimes the sexual predator threatens to physically harm the Volunteer or someone they care about.  They might also threaten to blackmail the Volunteer unless they comply.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tForce and violence&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tForce and Violence involves a direct physical attack to overpower a Volunteer.  It is what we frequently see on TV and in movies…like when the assailant jumps out of the bushes with a knife and attacks an unsuspecting jogger.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>

        •&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff will treat you with dignity and respect. No one deserves to be the victim of a sexual assault.
        Peace Corps will believe you if you report a rape or other sexual assault. No one at Peace Corps will blame you or think
        the assault was your fault.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff will take appropriate steps to provide for your ongoing safety. Every effort will be made to keep you at your site as long
        as it is safe for you to continue service. BUT – your safety must always come first.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff will provide you with the support you need to aid in your recovery. This means that Peace Corps will provide both
        medical care and emotional support following the event. Each case is handled based on the needs of the Volunteer
        and we do not automatically medevac or separate sexual assault victims from service. Although we may recommend medevac so
        that you can get the medical and psychological help you need, the decision to medevac is jointly determined by the Volunteer,
        the PCMO and the Counseling and Outreach Unit in Washington.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff will help you to understand the relevant legal processes and your legal options. Peace Corps understands there may be
        significant cultural, language and legal challenges and as a result will help you navigate the local system. If you are
        interested in reporting to the police, we will stand beside you at every step of the process.The decision to report to the police is
        yours and yours alone – we will respect whatever decision you make.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff will keep you informed of the progress of your case, should you choose to pursue prosecution. Peace Corps will ensure that you
        receive timely updates regarding your case whether or not you continue your service. A Victim Advocate will be available to answer
        any questions or concerns you have regarding the status of your case.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff will work closely with you to make decisions regarding your continued service. No decisions about your site and service will be
        made without your input and collaboration.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff will respect your privacy and will not, without your consent, disclose your identity or share the details of the incident with
        anyone who does not have a legitimate need to know. Only those people who will be directly involved in your medical, emotional
        and security support will know your identity. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;The Peace Corps Director has made it clear that all staff are expected to uphold these commitments, both in actions and words.
        If you are sexually assaulted and you feel that Peace Corps staff members are not living up to the agency’s commitment, you can:&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
    &lt;b>Contact the agency’s Office of Victim Advocacy, which is independent from staff at post.&lt;br/>
        &lt;br/>Contact the Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, which provides independent oversight of agency programs and operations
        through regular audits, evaluations and investigations.&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>

        The Immunity Policy does not grant immunity for any criminal or civil liability for violations of law.</string>
    <string name="mythbusters_subtitle5">FACT: You will not be alone in this. If you are interested in reporting to the police, we have specially trained staff that will explain the process involved in filing a police report and how the investigation and prosecution will
        be conducted. Peace Corps can also hire an attorney to
assist you with your legal options. Peace Corps will be with you every step of the way. Sometimes, the investigative and judicial process take a long time and will most likely be very different from the systems and procedures you may be familiar with in the United States.
        But even if you leave the country, Peace Corps will continue to work with the police and prosecutors and will keep you informed about your case.
</string>
    <string name="mythbusters_subtitle6">FACT:  When you report any crime or incident, it is extremely important to assess your safety and security. Staff at post, particularly your Safety and Security Manager, can help you create a safety plan that addresses safety concerns
        by creating solutions, contacts, and plans of action that will help keep you safe in the event of an emergency or encounter with an assailant.</string>
    <string name="mythbusters_subtitle7">FACT: If you experience this problem, there is something you can do. Volunteers who feel their incident was neglected can report their concerns to the Office of the Inspector General.
        Contact information for the OIG can be found at the end of this workbook. </string>
    <string name="mythbusters_subtitle8">FACT: This is untrue. Volunteers can pursue an internal Peace Corps administrative process through the Volunteer/Trainee Sexual Misconduct Policy.
        Initiating this process asks Peace Corps to address instances of sexual misconduct by other Volunteers separate from any criminal investigation or proceeding. The process allows Volunteers the opportunity to present a case for sexual misconduct before
        a hearing panel of Peace Corps officials who will assess the case and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary to penalize the offender. </string>
    <string name="mythbusters_subtitle9">FACT:  In many cases when a Volunteer is the victim of a crime, Interrupted Service is an option, which indicates that a Volunteer leaves service due to circumstances beyond their control. Additionally, if you are a victim of sexual assault,
        you are also entitled to a medevac (45 days) which may be located in your home of record or Washington, DC.  Medevacs allow for Volunteers to return to service at the end of the 45 day period.</string>

    <!-- Sexual Assault Awareness -->

    <string name="was_content">
       Even though the laws vary between countries, Peace Corps recognizes that sexual assault takes many forms. These include rape, attempted rape, and unwanted sexual contact, such as grabbing, fondling, or forced kissing.
        the legal definition of sexual assault differs among Peace Corps countries.  However, Peace Corps asks these questions to help the agency classify crimes of a sexual nature &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>Sexual Assault:&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Was there unwanted kissing on the mouth or touching of the Volunteer\'s genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks?  Were any of these acts attempted?&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>Aggravated Sexual Assault:&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Was there contact with the Volunteer’s genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or disrobing, or kissing AND any of the following: use of or threat of use of a weapon;
        or the use or threat of use of force or intimidation; or the Volunteer was incapable of giving consent?  Were any of these acts attempted?&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>Rape:&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Was the vagina, anus or mouth penetrated against the will of the Volunteer?  Was the Volunteer forced to perform oral sex on another person or penetrate another person against his/her will? &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
    </string>

    <string name="sexual_assault_info">
            If it is not consensual, then it is a crime.  Consensual means that both people are old enough to consent, have the capacity to consent, and agreed to the sexual contact.
        There are two main considerations to help Volunteers judge whether or not a sexual act is consensual.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>

        1.\t\t\tDid both people have the physical, mental, and legal capacity to consent?  Those with diminished capacity – for example, some people with disabilities,
            some elderly people and people who have been drugged or are unconscious – may not have the ability to consent to have sex.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        2.\t\t\tDid both participants agree to take part? Did someone use physical force to make you have sexual contact with him/her? Has someone threatened you or coerced you to make you
            have intercourse with them?  If so, it is sexual assault.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        If someone does not have the capacity to consent because they are too scared to say no, drunk or otherwise incapacitated, or one person does not want sexual contact, then it is sexual assault.
        This applies to rape or sexual assault of a Volunteer or Trainee by another Volunteer or Trainee.If a Volunteer is drunk or otherwise incapacitated then it is not consensual sex.
        If you are not sure if you were sexually assaulted, or even if something made you uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to discuss the incident with your PCMO or someone else you trust for support.
        Even if weeks, months, or years have passed, it is never too late to report an incident of sexual assault so you can receive support to aid your healing and recovery.
    </string>

    <string name="common_qs_title1">I didn’t physically resist – does that mean it wasn’t rape?</string>
    <string name="common_qs_title2">I used to date the person who assaulted me – does that mean it isn’t rape?</string>
    <string name="common_qs_title3">I was drunk or the other person was drunk – does that mean it isn’t rape?</string>
    <string name="common_qs_title4">I thought “no,” but didn’t say it – is it still rape?</string>
    <string name="common_qs_title5">I became sexually aroused even though I did not consent – is it still rape?</string>
    <string name="common_as1">People respond to an assault in many different ways. Just because you didn’t resist physically doesn’t mean it wasn’t rape – in fact, many victims experience the
        survival instinct to “freeze” and do not physically resist due to fear that their attacker might become more violent.  Lack of consent can be expressed (saying “no”)
        or can be implied through non-verbal cues and reactions by the non-consenting person.</string>
    <string name="common_as2">Sexual assault can occur when the offender and the victim have a pre-existing relationship, even if the offender is the victim’s spouse.
        It does not matter whether the other person is a former romantic partner or a complete stranger. It also doesn’t matter if you ever had sex in the past. If it is nonconsensual this time, it is rape.</string>
    <string name="common_as3">Alcohol and drugs are not an excuse. The key question is still: did you consent or not?
        Regardless of whether you were drunk or sober, if the sex is nonconsensual, it is rape. However, because each country has different definitions of “nonconsensual,”
        please contact your PCMO or SSM if you have questions about your specific host country definitions and laws.
        Peace Corps believes that if you were so intoxicated or drugged that you passed out and/or were unable to consent, it was rape. Both people must be conscious and willing participants.</string>
    <string name="common_as4">It depends on the circumstances. If you didn’t say no because you were legitimately scared for your life or safety, then it may be a sexual assault.
        In some cases it may be unsafe to resist, physically or verbally — for example, when someone has a knife or gun to your head, or threatens you, a fellow PCV, or community member if you say anything.</string>
    <string name="common_as5">Sexual arousal and/or orgasm during rape is extremely common, yet rarely talked about. It is biological. Sexual arousal works from the same autonomic,
        reflex-driven system associated with heart rate, digestion, and perspiration.  Sexual organs do not think, they are designed to respond to stimulation. Sexual arousal or orgasm during rape does not mean it felt good.
        It does not mean you enjoyed it. It does not mean you asked for it. It does not mean you consented. Becoming sexually aroused does not equal consent.</string>

    <string name="harassment_content">
        The Peace Corps is committed to maintaining high standards of conduct in the workplace and providing all employees, Volunteers, and trainees a work environment that is free from harassment of any kind.
        The Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, or OCRD, handles claims of harassment, including sexual harassment of a Volunteer or Trainee by a Peace Corps staff member or fellow Volunteer/ Trainee.
    </string>

    <string name="harassment_more">
        Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
        Sexual harassment is behavior that is unwelcome, offensive, can cause fear or anxiety and can impact job performance. The actions you may think are within tolerable ranges of acceptability
        may be offensive to others. People have different thresholds of tolerance for many of these behaviors.
        The bottom line is that ‘unwelcomed’ is determined by the recipient, not the person displaying the offensive conduct.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>

        If you feel you are being sexually harassed, sharing this with either a Volunteer or staff  will better ensure that you get the help and support you deserve.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Cases of sexual harassment committed by a PCV or Peace Corps Staff member against a PCV can be reported to the Office of Civil Rights and Diversity (OCRD)
